# Java_Quine
This program is a quine program.  A quine program is any program that prints its own source code.  

The purpose of this quine program was to find a none trival, but still simple approach to print the source code.  The trival approach for quine programs is to hard code a string that is identical to the source code.

This program makes use of the java Scanner class that reads the quine programs java file and prints it line by line.  This way even if more code is added later no edittig of a hard coded string is need.
